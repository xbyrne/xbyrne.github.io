				<li>
					<a href="cdt/Stats.pdf" target="_blank">Principles of Data Science.</a>
					Quite a nice rigorous course, but rather particle-physics-heavy, making some of the jargon used a
					bit
					difficult to parse.
				</li>
				<li class="notepdf">
					<a href="cdt/Data.pdf" target="_blank">Applied Data Science.</a>
					Whistle-stop. A bit messy at the start, but then became a good overview of a lot of different
					techniques.
				</li>
				<li class="notepdf">
					<a href="cdt/Bayes.pdf" target="_blank">Statistics of Data Science.</a>
					Probably one of the best courses I've ever taken at Cambridge. I never really got on with Bayesian
					statistics, but that's all changed.
				</li>
				<li class="notepdf">
					<a href="cdt/ML.pdf" target="_blank">Applications of Machine Learning.</a>
					Essentially consisted of taking an excellent textbook, and trying and failing to
					communicate it out loud. Later sections of the course were very rushed and lacked depth, as the
					scope of the course was a bit too ambitious.
				</li>
