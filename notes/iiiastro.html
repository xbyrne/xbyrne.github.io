				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiiastro/Fluids.pdf" target="_blank">Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics.</a>
						Masterfully taught, but needed a bit more structure, and it was in a weird order imo.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiiastro/Exoplanets.pdf" target="_blank">Exoplanets.</a>
						Deceptively in-depth. Looking back, I'm glad it went slowly! Lots of somewhat iffy and
						qualitative stuff -- a quite immature course.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiiastro/Exoplanets_Queloz.pdf" target="_blank">Exoplanets (Queloz).</a>
						I don't have enough evidence to say that winning a Nobel prize makes you a bad lecturer,
						but I have more than enough to say that being at the Cavendish does.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiiastro/BlackHoles.pdf" target="_blank">Astrophysical Black Holes.</a>
						Nice to compress what was a, uh, highly caffeinated lecture course
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiiastro/Disks.pdf" target="_blank">Disks.</a>
						Much as I would like to hate this course, I found it kinda nice.
						Might have been better suited to a 3-unit course though.
