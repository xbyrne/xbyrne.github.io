				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="iiiastro/Fluids.pdf" target="_blank">Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics.</a>
						Masterfully taught, but needed a bit more structure, and it was in a weird order imo.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="iiiastro/Exoplanets.pdf" target="_blank">Exoplanets.</a>
						Deceptively in-depth. Looking back, I'm glad it went slowly! Lots of somewhat iffy and
						qualitative stuff -- a quite immature course.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="iiiastro/Exoplanets_Queloz.pdf" target="_blank">Exoplanets (Queloz).</a>
						I don't have enough evidence to say that winning a Nobel prize makes you a bad lecturer,
						but I have more than enough to say that being at the Cavendish does.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="iiiastro/BlackHoles.pdf" target="_blank">Astrophysical Black Holes.</a>
						Nice to compress what was a, uh, highly caffeinated lecture course
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="iiiastro/Disks.pdf" target="_blank">Disks.</a>
						Much as I would like to hate this course, I found it kinda nice.
						Might have been better suited to a 3-unit course though.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<a href="https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~dab93/" target="_blank">David Bour</a> has also made
				<a href="https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~dab93/#teaching" target="_blank">excellent notes</a> on Part III Astrophysics.
				In particular, he has made notes on the Stars and Galaxies courses, which I didn't do.
