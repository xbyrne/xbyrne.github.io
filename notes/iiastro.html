					Equations which are given in the Formula Book are in green boxes; equations which aren’t
					in the FB that I think are important are in red boxes.
					<br><br>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiastro/Quantum.pdf" target="_blank">Principles of Quantum Mechanics.</a>
						Surprisingly easy to condense. I guess it’s easier to do that when you remove all the
						extraneous content. Also there’s actual diagrams rather than a faceless guy in a hi-vis.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiastro/Relativity.pdf" target="_blank">Relativity.</a>
						Surprisingly hard to condense there’s just so much content in this course. Shamefully
						long.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiastro/Galaxies.pdf" target="_blank">Stellar Dynamics + Structure of
							Galaxies.</a>
						This was very satisfying to make notes for, because ironically the course seemed to have
						very little structure to it, so it was nice to put things in a decent order.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiastro/Stars.pdf" target="_blank">Structure + Evolution of Stars.</a>
						A lot of the content in the lecture notes is extraneous and has never been examined, so
						I’ve
						trimmed a decent amount. Hopefully that makes it easier to wade through.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiastro/StatPhys.pdf" target="_blank">Statistical Physics.</a>
						Not as short as I would've wanted. Strap in for some long derivations and far too many
						colours.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiastro/Cosmology.pdf" target="_blank">Cosmology.</a>
						Making these notes made me realise just how all over the place this course was.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiastro/Fluids.pdf" target="_blank">Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics.</a>
						Nice as the lecture notes were, there were still places which I thought could be
						improved.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="notes/iiastro/Topics.pdf" target="_blank">Topics in Astrophysics.</a>
						Actually not too bad. Some of the derivations are beyond dodgy but oh well...
					</li>
				</ul>
