	<h3 style="color:white">The Plutonium Record</h3>

	You were like mayflies.

	<br><br>
	
	To be fair, at a life expectancy of almost a million years, we are probably the longest-lived of the dominant species of any inhabited planet in the galaxy.
	But it seems that most of those species could live to at least a few thousand.
	How did you get anything done in just 80 years??
	Life must have been very frantic.

	<br><br>

	Dominant species usually live near the surface of their planet, where the sun is plentiful, energy is everywhere, and everybody runs around in a mad rush, knowing that their next bit of energy will come soon enough.
	A mad, mad rush.

	<br><br>

	We, on the other hand, are cursed by a star that spews violent cosmic radiation alongside its sunlight.
	But our world is covered by a deep ocean, and here, two thousand kilometers below the surface, we are shielded from most of the radiation.
	It is true that we are also shielded from the light, but we have no choice but to dwell here, in the vast void; exiled, but protected.
	Photons are scarce, down here in the dark.
	Yesterday, my photon count was in triple figures!
	That was enough energy to finish writing the word 'dark' once and for all.
	That previous sentence took about two years.

	<br><br>

	From what I can gather, we look rather like the whales that inhabited the oceans of your planet.
	Their sounds were so majestic, so calm, albeit about ten octaves higher-pitched than our own.
	We are perhaps a thousand times larger than they were, but the basic anatomy was probably about the same.
	So if you want to picture us, we would perhaps look like leviathan whales, adapted to photosynthesise from the few crumbs of light that reach us.
	We do not have the decadent abundance of energy that you did.
	We live slow, simple lives, drifting through the nothingness.
	We can do everything you could do, it just takes many thousands of times longer.
	It's the secret to longevity, you know.

	<br><br>

	Your record was among the best.
	For one thing, it actually came with instructions.
	It took us 230,000 years to work out how to use the first one that we got, from Alpha Anseris.
	No information whatsoever about the rotation time, which way round it was supposed to be...
	You at least had the generosity to include the stylus.
	I was listening to the first greetings within a mere century of your probe being gifted to me.
	Though to be fair to the Anserians, we hadn't had much practice then.

	<br><br>
	
	Despite our slow lives, we too have developed Astronomy.
	Of course, we cannot build our telescopes down in the deep ocean, where almost no light reaches from above.
	When we build a telescope, we mount it onto a buoy, attached to transmission cables.
	Then we just let them float up to the surface, like a helium balloon on a string.
	Once they reach the surface, they only have to look the atmosphere: the data are carried down to us through the cables.
	On one dramatic occasion, the telescope had a problem with the mirror, and a few brave souls had to go all the way up there in ultra-pressurised suits to install the corrective optics.

	<br><br>

	I must say that I was impressed by your Titan III-Centaur launch.
	Our large size, as well as the strong gravity on our planet, makes it rather impractical to slip our surly bonds into the sanctity of space, as you did.
	It must have been a magnificent vista, to gaze back at your own world, the exquisite home of everybody you loved.
	It must have looked so indestructible, so strong, so capable of withstanding anything.

	<br><br>

	When the Alpha Anseris record was deciphered, as you can imagine, everyone was incredibly excited: our species' very first extraterrestrial message had arrived!
	Their record was quite different than yours.
	It was not audio-visual, but physical.
	When placed flat and played with the stylus positioned on the underside of the disk, the precise stimulation from the stylus caused the malleable material in the record to jump up into small plasticine shapes, which morphed and moved around, acting out miniature scenes from their world.
	We saw the shape of the Anserians themselves: they looked not unlike the tree toads from your planet, but bipedal, jumping with the joy of a child from one foot to the other as they ringmastered the show playing out on the stage of the record.
	They showed us scenes from their planet: constellations of tiny islands dotting a blue-white ocean; great rivers snaking out of grand mountain ranges; the Anserian autumn, and winter.
	They showed us their ecology: brilliant red trees, blue roses, and a deep green sky.
	They showed us their culture: their food, their sculpture.

	<br><br>

	And their dancing.
	Oh, their dancing!
	I really wish you could have seen it.
	Such energy, such passion, as though the gift of life was meant for that one purpose alone, everything else in the dancers' complicated lives flung far away into the distance, for a minute or two.
	Those frog-like figurines dancing on the disk was the most beautiful sight that I have ever witnessed in my million years of life.

	<br><br>

	Once we deciphered their "sign language", we played back their introduction:

	<br><br>
	<i>
	This record is a gift to you.
	It originated on a small, faraway world.
	It contains some of our shapes, our science, our dance, our art, our ideas and our emotions.
	We are trying to survive through our time so we may live into yours.
	We hope that eventually, having solved the problems ahead of us, to join a community of galactic civilisations.
	This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.
	</i>
	<br><br>

	Naturally, we quickly directed all of our telescopes towards Alpha Anseris.
	We had studied this star before, but it, too, is rather active.
	Nowhere near as active as our own (fortunately for the land-dwelling Anserians), but active enough to make it difficult to study its planets without an enormously expensive observing campaign.
	But now, the potential return on investment was the knowledge of another civilisation to with which to share the cosmos, and enough funds were secured to observe the Alpha Anseris system with incredible accuracy.

	<br><br>

	The initial observations of the Anserian world showed it to be oxygen-rich, with a trace of CO<sub>2</sub> and some bona fide biosignatures.
	We were getting excited: a new world! A new civilisation!
	The dancing little creatures weren't just data on a disk.
	Those dances, those beautiful, beautiful dances, were happening somewhere out there, between the vermillion trees.

	<br><br>

	I had the privilege of being at the research centre of one of the telescopes, as one of the data analysts.
	I was the first to notice a big spike in the spectrum of the Anserian atmosphere.
	The initial data were a bit blurry, but the wavelength of the spike was somewhere between 453 and 454 nanometres.
	It was initially dismissed as some fault with the detectors, but soon, other telescopes around the world started finding the same spike.
	As more data came in, the precise wavelength of the spike was gradually narrowed down, and while some vocal pessimists suggested what we now know to be true, most people still thought it was just due to some harmless neon in the planet's atmosphere.

	<br><br>

	An entirely new telescope was commissioned, with the sole purpose of uncovering the source of the spike.
	But it only confirmed our worst fears.
	The spike was located at a wavelength of precisely 453.6146 nanometres, a wavelength that could signify only one thing -- the detonation of an apocalyptic nuclear explosion.

	<br><br>

	Ours is a vast galaxy.
	Almost any kind of setting you can conceive of exists out there somewhere.
	Moulded by its environment, life comes in all shapes and sizes.
	But regardless of what the Anserian biology was like, we know that they are gone.
	No organism could have survived the radiation levels we detected on that planet, not the smallest insect.
	The planet was rendered utterly uninhabitable.

	<br><br>

	Make no mistake, Alpha Anseris is fairly isolated -- they were not the victims of some interstellar war.
	It was the Anserians themselves, who had wiped out every last tree, every last rose, every chef, every sculptor, every dancer.
	Their sky has turned black.
	And back here in our ocean world, we once again found ourselves alone, drifting through the void.
	
	<br><br>

	After hearing news of the 453.6146 nanometre spike, I was totally and completely devastated.
	An entire ecosystem, an entire cultural macrocosm, erased from a Universe that was lonely enough already.
	I took the Anserian record and fled the research centre; I needed some time to myself.
	I played the record again, the whole way through, on repeat, maybe a hundred times.

	<br><br>

	Their dances made me cry.

	<br><br>

	<hr style="width:50%">

	<br>

	Since Alpha Anseris, many hundreds of records have reached our world: hundreds of messages in bottles, washed up on our shore.
	Physically, the records were made of gold, or silver, or carbide, or platinum.
	They were auditory, olfactory, optical, holographic... the record from Zeta Zygopterae even had a built-in return mechanism, not that there was any point.
	The science developed by the various species was remarkably similar: everybody seems to have developed some kind of thermodynamics, relativity, and quantum mechanics.
	And everybody had astronauts, except us, but it seems none of them knew about each other.
	There has never been any footage or audio of <i>two</i> dominant species, from different planets, meeting up together to discuss their respective sciences, or share in their respective traditions.
	Each record portrays a lonely, lost child, calling out into the cold vacuum.
	
	<br><br>

	What <i>no</i> two records shared in common was the culture of the species that created them.
	Even on any given record -- yours is a prime example -- there was a dazzling array of architectures, athletes, artisans, parties, craftsmen and chefs.
	The smorgasbord of ways in which the peoples of your planet responded to the unbridled predicament of life was multiplied on every record we received.

	<br><br>

	Every time a record was recovered, played, and translated, we looked up towards the distant world that sent it, with its medley of lifestyles and societies held hopefully in our minds.
	But every time, there was a 453.6146 nanometre spike.
	Every. Single. Time.
	We've received hundreds of these, and it seems that no sooner does a record get sent out as its senders self-destruct.
	Every record is a refugee, fleeing its world just before it crescendoes towards extinction.

	<br><br>

	Being let down by the Universe that many times takes its toll.
	My species has the ability, or perhaps the burden, of choosing when we want to die.
	But even if I were not in my old age I would know that my time has come.
	I cannot take another disappointment.
	As per tradition, I paid a visit to a friend to give notice of my decision, and to request a token to take with me as I descend to the depths of the dark ocean.
	With a compassionate smile, my colleague remarked at my perfect timing.
	He told me that a probe had very recently splashed down overhead, he had just finished copying and/ deciphering the data on the record, and researchers were about to take a look at its planet of origin.
	Although he knew the answer, he asked if I was really sure that I didn't want to wait for the results.
	At that, I laughed the saddest laugh the Universe had ever had the misfortune of hearing.
	My colleague smiled again, and handed me the newly-deciphered golden record, from your probe, <i>Voyager</i>.

	<br><br>

	I played your record on the way down.
	I had gotten into the habit of skimming through the last few records that arrived, but as this was my last one I though I might as well give it my full attention and play it the whole way through.
	It was very enjoyable: good visuals, not much filler, and gorgeous music (though it did seem a bit like you were trying to show off at times!).
	I will never know what happened to your world, though I hope you will forgive my suspicions.
	Maybe I'm just an old pessimist.
	Maybe you will avoid the fate met by so many other civilisations, in their quest for some sort of supremacy over themselves.
	Maybe you will survive yourselves.

	<br><br>

	But I doubt it.
