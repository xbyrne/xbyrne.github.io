	<h3>The Plutonium Record</h3>

	You were like mayflies.

	<br><br>
	
	True, at a life expectancy of almost a million years, we are probably the longest-lived of the dominator species on any inhabited world in the galaxy.
	But it seems that most of them lived to at least a few tens of thousands.
	How did you get anything done in just 80 years??
	Life must have been very frantic.

	<br><br>

	On most inhabited worlds, the dominator species lived at or near the surface, where the sun is plentiful, energy is everywhere, and everybody runs around in a mad rush, knowing that their next bit of energy will come soon enough.
	A mad, mad rush.
	We, on the other hand, are cursed by a very active star, giving out not just light, but violent cosmic radiation.
	As such, we are forced to drift two thousand kilometers below the surface of the deep ocean that covers our world.
	Any higher up than that and the radiation becomes deadly, so we must live here, protected, but exiled.
	Photons are scarce, down here in the dark.
	I got into double figures yesterday for photons!
	That was enough to finish writing the word 'dark' once and for all.
	That previous sentence took about two years.

	<br><br>

	From what I can gather, we are rather like the whales that inhabited your planet's oceans.
	Only, it seems like they left the ocean at some point, went onto dry rock, before going back into the ocean.
	I guess land isn't all it's cracked up to be!
	Their sounds were beautiful, if about ten octaves higher-pitched than our own speech.
	The whales were probably about a thousand times smaller than us, but the basic anatomy was probably about right.
	So to you we would have been perhaps leviathan whales, to some rough approximation.
	We do not have the privilege of abundant energy sources, and live slow, simple lives, drifting through the void.
	It's the secret to longevity, you know.

	<br><br>

	Your record was among the best.
	For one thing, it actually came with instructions.
	It took us 230,000 years to work out how to use the first one that we got, from Alpha Anseris.
	No information whatsoever about the rotation time, which way round it was supposed to be...
	You guys at least had the foresight to include the stylus.
	I was listening to the first greetings within a couple of centuries of the probe splashing down into the ocean.
	Though to be fair, we have had rather a lot of practice by since Anseris.

	<br><br>
	
	Despite our slow lives, we too have developed Astronomy.
	Of course, we cannot build our telescopes down here in the deep ocean where almost no light reaches; we build them onto buoys, attach the buoys to transmission cables, and let them float up to the top.
	Once they reach the surface, all they have to look through is the atmosphere.
	On one occasion, the telescope had a problem with the mirror, and a couple of brave souls had to go all the way up there in ultra-pressurised suits to install the corrective optics.
	I was impressed by your Titan III-Centaur launch.
	Our large size, as well as the stronger gravity on our planet, makes it rather impractical to slip our surly bonds into the sanctity of space.

	<br><br>

	We were incredibly excited when we deciphered the Anseris record, our species' very first extraterrestrial contact.
	Their record was not audiological, but tactile.
	When placed flat and played with the stylus positioned underneath the disk, the precise stimulation from the stylus caused the malleable material in the record to jump up into small plasticine-like shapes, which moved around and acted out scenes from their world, on the stage of the record.
	We saw the shape of the Anserians themselves -- they looked not unlike the tree toads from your planet, but bipedal, jumping with the joy of a child from one foot to the other as they ringmastered the show playing out on the record.
	We saw scenes from their planet: their tiny islands, their busy forests, their autumn and winter.
	We saw their wildlife: brilliant red trees, blue roses; their deep green sky.
	We saw their culture: their food, their sculpture.
	And their dancing.
	Oh, their dancing!
	I really wish you could have seen it.
	Such joy, such passion, as though they wanted to use the gift of life for precisely this purpose.
	Their dancing was the most beautiful thing that I have ever witnessed in my million years of life.

	<br><br>

	Once we deciphered their "sign language", we watched back their introduction:

	<br><br>
	<i>
	This record is a gift to you.
	It originated on a small, faraway world.
	It contains some of our shapes, our science, our dance, our art, our ideas and our emotions.
	We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours.
	</i>
	<br><br>

	Naturally, we quickly trained all of our telescopes on Alpha Anseris.
	We had studied this star before, but it, too, is rather active.
	Nowhere near as active as ours (fortunately for the land-dwelling Anserians), but active enough to make it impossible to study its planets without an enormously expensive observing campaign.
	But now, the potential return on investment was the knowledge of another civilisation to with which to share the cosmos, and enough funds were secured to observe the Alpha Anseris, and its inhabited world, with incredible accuracy.

	<br><br>

	The initial observations of the Anserian world showed it to be oxygen-rich, with a trace of CO<sub>2</sub> and some bona fide biosignatures.
	We were getting excited: a new world!
	A new species!
	The dancing little frog creatures weren't just data on a disk.
	Those dances, those beautiful, beautiful dances, were playing out somewhere out there, in the vermillion forests.

	<br><br>

	I had the privilege of being one of the analysts of the telescopes' data: I was the first to notice a big spike in the Anserian atmosphere's spectrum between 4530 and 4540 Angstroms, which was initially dismissed as some fault with the detectors.
	But soon, other telescopes started finding the same spike.
	As more data came in from our various telescopes all over the ocean surface, the wavelength of the spike was gradually narrowed down, and while there were always some pessimists, most people still thought the spike was just due to some harmless atmospheric neon or something.
	An entirely new telescope was commissioned to precisely uncover the nature of the spike.
	But it only confirmed our worst fears.
	The spike was located at a wavelength of precisely 4536.146 Angstroms, a wavelength that could signify only one thing -- the detonation of an apocalyptic nuclear explosion.

	<br><br>

	Life comes in all shapes and sizes, but nothing could have survived the radiation levels we detected on that planet, not the smallest insect.
	Make no mistake, Alpha Anseris is fairly isolated -- this was not some interstellar war.
	The Anserians had wiped out every last tree, every last rose, every chef, every sculptor, every dancer.
	We found ourselves once more alone, drifting through the void.
	
	<br><br>

	After hearing news of the 4536.146 Angstrom spike, I fell into a deep depression, from which I don't feel I have truly recovered.
	Shortly after, I played through the Anserian record again, the whole way through, on repeat, perhaps a hundred times.

	<br><br>

	Their dances made me cry.
