				<h1>Here's some <br> notes I made for Uni <span style="color:#b369ff">&#10145;</span></h1>

				<p class="lead">In my time at Cambridge, I have often felt that the notes we are given could be
					improved. So I made some of my own.</p>
				<p style="color:#b1b1b1"> The notes are written by and for me, and so they’re a bit idiosyncratic, but
					some people say they’re helpful. Whether that says more about me,
					those people, or Cambridge I don’t know.
					For me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme%E2%80%93color_synesthesia"
						style="color:#B369FF" target="_blank">colour helps to recognise variables</a>, so you'll often
					find that the notes are jarringly colourful. Also, I generally try to assume the reader knows most
					of the relevant maths, with the justification
					that otherwise the notes would sprawl and I wanted them to be brief, and that they're really
					supposed to be more about (astro)physics anyway.</p>
